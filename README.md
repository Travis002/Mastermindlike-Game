# Overview
This is a Mastermind-like game that contains a GUI for playing the game.
The player has 5 colors to choose from, which they use to guess a password that
contains 4 colors. They have unlimited attempts to guess the password. The computer
creates the password, and feedback is given on how many colors were correct and how many
colors were misplaced. Optionally, an Arduino can be used to indicate which colors
were misplaced and which were correct.
